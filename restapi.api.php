 * the following configuration options:
 * - class: (required) The class that will handle this endpoint.
 * - auth: (optional) The class that will handle custom authentication. This
 *   class must implement Auth\AuthenticationServiceInterface. By default,
 *   resources without this option defined will use the
 *   DrupalAuthenticationService. This class can be configured via the
 *   "restapi_default_auth_class" variable.
 * - config: (optional) The class that will hold the custom configuration for
 *   the resource. By default, resource configurations are handled by
 *   ResourceConfiguration, but this allows any class that implements
 *   ResourceConfigurationInterface to handle its own configuration and thus
 *   resource invocation (via invokeResource method).
